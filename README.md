### What is a GitHub? 
 - `GitHub`:  is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers. ... GitHub facilitates social coding by providing a web interface to the Git code repository and management tools for collaboration. GitHub can be thought of as a serious social networking site for software developers.
> Is GitHub only for code?
GitHub is so often touted as a tool for coding projects that it's easy to forget just how useful a resource it is for everything else.
