# HTML 
## Text:
When we built a web, we add some tag knows as a markup to the contents in the page that help us to 
Design a web and make it more useful and allow to browser show the structure of the web.
Will focus how to add a markup to the text, there’s a two type of structure will be see it now.
•	**Structural markup**
this is markup in html that gives information about the structure of a document. It may also be associated with a change in appearance, but the key is that it provides information about divisions, titles, sections, paragraphs, or other aspects of the structure of a document.
•	**Semantic markup**
Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Elements such as header,footer and article are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them.

> Structural markup : 

1 - HEADINGS : html has six level of element from h1 to h6. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least. And the brewers show the heading in different size.
 > NOTE ; THERS NO HEADING 7 THERE ARE JUST 6 .

2 -  PARAGAPHS : we use <p> tag to create a paragraph , by default every paragraph will show in different line.

3 – BOLD AND ITALIC : The bold tag b you can putting inside paragraph and chose any word and sign it by this tag but don’t foregate it to close it </b>,By enclosing words in the tags and we can make characters appear italic.
4 - SUPERSCRIP AND SUBSCRIPT : The sup tag defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like WWW. Tip: Use the <sub> tag to define subscript text.

5 - WHITE SPACE : its very used element to use its make a code more easier and web page add extra space or start some element, like if you put space by mistake between word have a large space it will not show it .

6 - LINE BREAKS AND HORIZNTAL RULES : break element <br> if you want to add a new line you can use it inside a paragraph element. There are a few elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. They are known as empty elements and they are written differently like horizontal element  you can used it if you want to write book like html book .

 > Semantic Markup:
  

1 - STRONG : its used if you write the strong information you can use this element to make this paragraph more stronger by make it bold.

2 – EMPHASIS:  The element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence by default it will show the paragraph in italic style. 

3 – QUOTATIONS: there is two type of element we can used to make quotations, q element indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the blockquote element.

4 – ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS : The HTML Abbreviation element *<abbr>* represents an abbreviation or acronym; the optional title attribute can provide an expansion or description for the abbreviation. If present, title must contain this full description and nothing else.
5 – CITAYIONS AND DEFINITIONS : citations cite its used to indicate where the citation is from. Like books or reference of paper. And the definitions <def> element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term. Some web will show it like italics.

6 -  AUTHOR DETILS : will be used at it the address it will be show the contents of author or his email,I thinks it  something not very important to know about it. 

7 – CHANGES TO CONTENT : ins,del and S , the  ins element used to show content putting into  a document and it will be showed like have line under it.del will show text that has been deleted from it the final one is sshow text that has been deleted from it ,the line will be phased out in the word .

# CSS : 
-CSS can be used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. CSS gives Web developers more exact control over how Web pages will look than HTML does.

> css selectors :
thers a lot of css selectore its used every select have rule or target to used. but you must know every selector are very sensitve.so its must match same name you have wirte it.two of theme we have used it there are class and id. if i write more than orde in one element, i must know which one will be done first. when i read i see you can put ! these element to change order and make this more important than other.
